	<h1>The American School in London</h1> 
	
	<p>The American School in London is an international, private, independent K-12 school in St John's Wood, London, England for students aged between 4 and 18 years. It was established in 1951 by journalist Stephen Eckard.</p> 
	
	<p>The American School in London welcomed U.S. President Barack Obama for a visit during the 2008-2009 school year. Presidents Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton have also met with ASL students and parents during visits to London.</p>
